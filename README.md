**Real Talk**  
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is both a crime and a tragedy, for which Russian President Vladimir Putin bears responsibility.  
Thousands have died due to Putin's senseless and barbaric acts, and millions have been displaced.  
If the war continues, these numbers will only get higher.  
Though this game carries an air of levity, the situation in reality carries the opposite.  
On March 17, 2023, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Vladimir Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova, the Russian Commissioner for Children's Rights, due to their responsibility for the unlawful deportation and transport of Ukranian children.  
Some estimates list the number of children stolen to be as high as 307,000. This constitutes a genocide. The abducted children have been subject to forced separation from their parents, as well as a "Russification" program that seeks to erase their national identity.  
Some returned children have attested to harsh punishments and restrictive living conditions while in while Russia.  
Putin and his co-conspirators must be put to justice. The Russian invasion of Ukraine must end.  
**Слава Україні!**
